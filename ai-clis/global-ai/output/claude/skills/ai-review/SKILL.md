  Code review on Git changes using the `ocr` CLI from alibaba/open-code-review
  in delegation mode: OCR handles deterministic engineering (file selection,
  rule resolution) while the host agent performs the review itself with its
  own intelligence and tools. Use when the user asks to review code, review
  a pull request, review staged/unstaged changes, review a commit, or
  compare branches for code quality issues. Produces line-level review
  comments and can automatically apply fixes when requested.
compatibility: >
  Requires the `ocr` CLI installed (via `npm install -g
  @alibaba-group/open-code-review` or GitHub release binary). Does NOT
  require a configured LLM endpoint — delegation mode is LLM-free on the
  OCR side.

# Open Code Review — Delegation Mode

A skill for performing AI code review where OCR provides deterministic engineering (file filtering, rule resolution) and the host agent performs the actual review using its own intelligence and tools.

## Proper Agent Usage

**Note**: This skill is only to be used within a @reviewer subagent. If not within a reviewer subagent, call one and have it run the review.

## Prerequisites

```bash
which ocr || echo "NOT INSTALLED"
```

If `ocr` is not installed:

```bash
npm install -g @alibaba-group/open-code-review
```

No LLM configuration is needed for delegation mode.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Preview — Determine What to Review

```bash
ocr delegate preview --format json [--from <ref> --to <ref>] [--commit <hash>] [--exclude <patterns>]
```

This outputs:
- **mode** (workspace / range / commit)
- **from / to / commit / merge_base** — ref metadata for constructing git commands
- **Reviewable file list** — paths, status, insertions/deletions
- **Excluded files** — with exclusion reason

**Common invocations:**

| Scenario | Command |
|----------|---------|
| Workspace changes | `ocr delegate preview` |
| Branch comparison | `ocr delegate preview --from main --to feature` |
| Single commit | `ocr delegate preview -c abc123` |

### Step 2: Get Rules for Files

```bash
ocr delegate rule --format json <path1> <path2> ...
```

Pass the reviewable file paths from Step 1. Output is grouped by rule content — files sharing the same rule appear under one group, avoiding repetition.

### Step 3: Get Diffs

Use git directly based on the mode/ref info from Step 1:

**Range mode** (merge_base provided in preview output):
```bash
git diff <merge_base>..<to> -- <path>
```

**Commit mode**:
```bash
git show <commit> -- <path>
```

**Workspace mode**:
```bash
# Tracked files
git diff HEAD -- <path>
# New untracked files — read directly (entire file is new code)
cat <path>
```

### Step 4: Review Each File

Create a checklist containing every `reviewable_files` entry. For each reviewable file:

Use `(path, status)` as the checklist identity. Workspace mode can report the same path twice when a staged deletion is followed by an untracked recreation.

1. Get its diff (Step 3)
2. Consult its Rule Group (from Step 2) for the review checklist
3. Conduct a thorough review, using appropriate context tools as needed
4. Mark the file `reviewed`, or `skipped` with a concrete reason

For large changes, review in bounded batches grouped by shared rules and diff size. Do not stop after finding the first high-severity issue.

### Step 5: Format Output

Each comment must follow this structure:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| path | string | yes | Relative file path |
| content | string | yes | Review comment describing the issue |
| start_line | integer | no | Start line in the new file |
| end_line | integer | no | End line in the new file |
| category | enum | no | bug, security, performance, maintainability, test, style, documentation, other |
| severity | enum | no | critical, high, medium, low |

### Step 6: Classify and Report

Before reporting, verify that every previewed file is accounted for. Include `total_files`, `reviewed_files`, `skipped_files`, and `coverage_rate` in the summary. A skipped file must include its reason.

Group findings by severity:

- **Critical/High**: Bugs, security issues, data loss risks — always report
- **Medium**: Performance concerns, error handling gaps, maintainability issues — report with context
- **Low**: Style nits, minor suggestions — report only if clearly valuable

Discard likely false positives silently.

### Step 7: Fix

Before applying fixes, check whether the user requested automatic fixes:

- If the user explicitly requested "review and fix" or similar, proceed with automatic fixes
- If the user only requested "review" without fix intent, ask for permission before applying any changes

When fixing issues and suggestions:

- Focus on High and Medium priority items
- Apply fixes directly to the code when safe and well-defined
- For complex fixes requiring manual intervention, clearly describe what needs to be done
- Skip Low-priority items unless trivial
- Always verify fixes with the user before committing

### Step 8: Re-review

If there were fixes that needed to be addressed in step 7, **after** the fixes are implemented we want to run a new code review.

Redo steps 1-7 with a new review and repeat until we have no **high** or **medium** errors.

## Output Format

After filtering comments by priority, present results using this template:

```markdown
## Code Review Results

**Files reviewed**: N
**Issues found**: X high priority / Y medium priority

### High Priority

- **`path/to/file.java:42`** — Brief description
  > Recommendation: How to fix

### Medium Priority

- **`path/to/file.ts:88`** — Brief description
  > Recommendation: How to fix (if applicable)
```

If the review found no issues after filtering, simply state: "Review complete — no issues found in N files."

**Priority classification:**

- **High**: Obvious bugs, security issues, clear mistakes, or well-founded suggestions with precise fix proposals
- **Medium**: Reasonable concerns but context-dependent, style/performance suggestions, or fixes that require manual implementation
- **Low**: Discarded silently (likely false positives, lacking context, nitpicks, or meaningless suggestions)

**Handling mispositioned comments:**

When `start_line` and `end_line` are both `0`, the comment failed to locate the exact position in the file. In such cases:

1. Read the comment content to understand the issue
2. Examine the target file mentioned in the comment
3. Identify the relevant code section based on the comment's context
4. Apply the fix or suggestion to the correct location

## Review Background

Analyze the `docs/` path and pass in as `--background` flag information any product and functional spec docs that are relevant to the ticket at hand.

## Final Output

1. Output the code review to the `code_reviews/<ticket>/code_review_x.md` where `x` starts at 1 and increments up each time if the previous exists. If the ticket includes numbers (e.g. "5-7-new-api-route.md"), the numbers are the ticket number (file created should be `code_reviews/5-7/code_review_1.md` for example). The command/orchestrator must create the parent directory and write the final Markdown review using shell redirection or `tee` — not the edit/write tools (these are denied). For example:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p "$(dirname "$output_file")"; <review-output-command> | tee "$output_file"
   ```

**Note**: If `<ticket>` does not exist, prior to calling the AI reviewer CLI, generate a 1-3 hyphenated summary (e.g. `test-local-dev`) to be the name.

2. Output the review to the user as well. Do not show anything other what the review/skill mentions as the output.

## Sub-commands Reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `ocr delegate preview` | Which files to review + mode/ref metadata |
| `ocr delegate rule <path...>` | Review rules grouped by content |

## Shared Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--from <ref>` | Source ref for range mode |
| `--to <ref>` | Target ref for range mode |
| `-c, --commit <hash>` | Single commit mode |
| `--repo <path>` | Repository root (default: cwd) |
| `--rule <path>` | Custom rule.json path |
| `--exclude <patterns>` | Comma-separated exclude patterns |
| `-b, --background <text>` | Business context |
| `-B, --background-file <path>` | Business context from Markdown file |
| `-f, --format <text\|json>` | Output format; use `json` for agent integrations |

## Gotchas

- **No LLM needed on OCR side** — delegation mode never calls an LLM. All intelligence comes from the host agent.
- **Rules are grouped** — Files sharing the same rule are grouped together in the output. You can pass any number of paths per call; for large changes, fetch rules per-batch as you review.
- **Working directory matters** — `ocr delegate` operates on the Git repo at the current directory. Use `--repo /path` to override.
- **Untracked files in workspace mode** — `preview` includes untracked files. For these, read the file directly instead of using `git diff`.
- **Background context** — pass `--background` to `preview` when you have requirement context; it appears in the output for your reference during review.
- **Coverage is mandatory** — every `reviewable_files` entry must be correct or explicitly skipped; do not silently omit files.

## Validation

After the review completes, verify success by checking:

1. The command exited with code 0
2. Comments were generated (or "No comments generated" message appears)
3. Warnings (if any) are displayed in stderr

If errors occurred, check the stderr warnings for details about which files failed and why.
